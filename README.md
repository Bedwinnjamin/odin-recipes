I have learned a lot of basics with The Odin Project
Hopefully I will carry through and become better at Full Stack Development

In this simple repository, I hope to use what I've learned so far to create a simple site

Using a HTML boiler plate, the learned tags (title, h1-h6, p, a, img, ol, ul, li) we'll see what I can do
